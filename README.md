# Creating Weighted Graph and Finding Shortest Paths using Python NetworkX
This project demonstrates how to create a weighted graph and visualize it graphically using Python NetworkX library (or its equivalent). Additionally, it shows how to find the shortest path lengths from node 4 to all other nodes in the graph using the built-in dijkstra_path function.
## Requirements
To run the code provided in this repository, you will need the following: <br>
•Python NetworkX library (make sure to install it using pip install networkx if you don't have it yet) <br>
•Python matplotlib library (make sure to install it using pip install networkx if you don't have it yet)
## Instructions
**1-** First of all, the graph given below should be drawn exactly similar along with the weight values. <br>

**2-** As a final step, print the shortest distances from the 4th node to all other nodes using the dijkstra_path command.
